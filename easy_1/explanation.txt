question:
add two numbers of an array to show the desired result and print the indexes
explanation:
we use two loops one traverses the whole array and adds consecutive numbers
the second loop traverses the array by selecting one element and comparing it with the rest
skips only if the indexes are same for the all the testcases to pass
