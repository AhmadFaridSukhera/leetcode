Question:
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Explanation:
Firstly, I store the linked list in an array using a loop and then sort the array.
Secondly, I create a new linked list to store all the elements of the sorted array. Since the new list is intitialized
as an empty list, I store the value in the current.next.
Lastly, I return the linked list with the .next as that is where the original value is stored.
